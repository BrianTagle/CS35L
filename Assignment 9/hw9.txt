1) Maintain this log, hw9, for this homework.

2) Enter the diffutils-original directory we created in the lab and checkout a clean copy of Diffutils version 3 and name it "quote".
`git checkout v3.0 -b quote`

3) Apply the patch quote-3.0-patch.txt that we made in the lab.
`patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt`
We get 6 lines of output from the patch, one line for every file succesfully patched.

4) Learn how to use the emacs functions add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)

5) open emacs and use C-x 4 a to create a changelog
I copied text from Eggert's git commit log from Jan 25th 2012 that I have a copy of from the lab as git-logs.txt
I removed parts referencing changing quotes in comments because that was unneccesary for our patch.
I also removed references to miscellanous changes to none .c files.
Other than that the text from Eggert's log remains roughly the same in my patch changelog.

My Changelog:
	* maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

	    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
	    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
	    `like this' or ``like this''.

	    * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
	    * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
	    (compare_files):
	    * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
	    (read_diff):
	    * src/dir.c (compare_names):
	    * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
	    * src/util.c (finish_output):
	    Quote 'like this' in output.

6) Commit the changes with the changelog message we made
`git add .`
`git commit -F Changelog`

7) Create a formatted patchfile
`git format-patch --stdout -1 > formatted-patch.txt`

8) With my partner we exchange formatted patch files and then apply them to confirm that they work in a new branch named partner
`git checkout v3.0 -b partner`
`git am formatted-patch.txt` (this is my partner's formatted patch, not mine)
`./bootstrap`
`patch -p1 < ../diffutils-gets.diff` (because I am on lnxsrv09 I need this patch)
`./configure`
`make`
`make check`

9) Verify my Changelog entry works
`make distdir`
`cd diffutils-3.0.1-47b5`
`emacs Changelog`
The Changelog I made has been added to the larger Changelog file so my entry has succesfully been added.

10) Get a copy of emacs git repository and run gitk to find the newest merge that is older than 2015-01-25.
`git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git emacsRepo`
`cd emacsRepo`
`gitk`

The merge neweset merge before 2015-01-25 is on 2015-01-24 19:00:41 made by Professor Eggert.
