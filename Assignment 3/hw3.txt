Q1. This patch actually improves the performance of the ls command.  looking at
   the diff file that was used to patch ls, we can see that an if statement was
   removed to fix the bug, slightly improving the perfomance of ls because the
   machine no longer has to check this condition.    

Q2. Since I only applied the patch for the ls bug and not any other changes it
   is unlikely for the new version of coreutils to introduce new problems in the
   future.  The one possibility for problems is exactly how the ls bug was 
   originally introduced into coreutils.  The ls bug did not exist until 
   changes came with POSIX.1-2008.  If this specification changes once again ls
   may not function properly accoriding to POSIX. 
	
Q3. `python randline.py /dev/null` gives the error:
   IndexError: list index out of range
   It gives this error because even though the file is empty, randline.pu still
   attempts to search for a line where none exists and when it tries to operate
   on a line where in reality there is no line, the behavior is undefined.
Q4. `python3 randline.py
     File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   the syntax changed from python2 to python3 which causes this error.
   the specific change is that in python3, IOError was marged into OSError so
   the IOError in this code needs to change to align with python3 syntax. The 
   change would be changing the previous section to 
except OSError as err:
