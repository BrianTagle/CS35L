   Verify that the bug still exists before prepending anything to my path.
   `ls -Aa`
   `ls -aA`
   both of these commands output the directories . and .. when the command with
   options -aA should not because A should overide a.  

1. Navigate to the directory I am using for this lab
   `cd CS35L/assign3/`
   I retrieved the Coreutils tar file from the assignment page with
   `wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz`

   then I check the check the signature of this command with the GNU keyring
   first acquire both the signature and the gnu-keyring with the commands 
   `wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig`
   `wget gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig`

   then checking the signature with
   `gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig`
   
   This command verifies that the signature if valid but warns that it is not
   certified with a trusted signature, so anyone could have made this signature

2. Extract the source files from the compressed tarball
   `tar xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz`
   this creates a directory named coreutils-8.29 in my current directory

   in the new directory coreutils-8.29 there is a file named INSTALL that
   explains how to install coreutils into a temporary directory.
   run these commands in the folliwng order 
   `./configure --prefix=/u/eng/ugrad/tagle/CS35L/assign3/coreutilsInstall`
   `make`
   `make install`
   to compile install the package to the specified path

3. I recreated the bug in the coreutilsInstall by comparing the output of
   `ls -aA` and `./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA`
   (ls is the command in the prefix /usr/local/cs/bin and 
   ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls is the command in the coreutilsInstall directory.)
  
   Just as the bug described, the coreutils ls -aA command output the . and .. 
   directories while the /usr/local/cs/bin ls -aA did not output them.

4. Install the patch
   Copy the the portion of the patch relating to ls which is 
diff --git a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c
index c89a22f68..bae2c1104 100644
--- a/src/ls.c

         case 'B':
   copy this into a file in the coreutils-8.29 direcotry
   `cd coreutils-8.29`
   `touch patchfile` 
    (copy the diff text above into patchfile)
   `patch -p1 < pathfile`

   the output is
patching file src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
   which means the patch was applied successfully

5. finalize the patch by running the command
   `make`
    this will apply the patch to /src/ls.c in the coreutils-8.29 directory
    output of `make`:

   Analyzing the output, you can see the function of the make command as it 
   looks in several subdirectories of coreutils-8.29 for changes to make.  
   however there are no changes needed in many directories such as /po and
   /gnulin-tests so the make command enters and leaves these directories
   quickly.  The only changes needed are in /src/ls which is where the make 
   command makes changes.

6. test that the patch worked by using the ls command in coreutils-8.29
   compare ls -aA to ./src/ls -aA and compare ls -Aa to ./src/ls -Aa

   the patch was successful! ./src/ls now has option A overide previous a and 
   vice versa.  ./src/ls -aA doesnt list ., .. while ./src/ls does list them.
