Lab Partner: Jack Brewer

My BeagleBone IP address: 10.97.85.103

As a host:

I created a user for my partner Jack on my BeagleBone
$ sudo useradd -d /home/jack -m jack
Then I added a password for him
$ sudo passwd jack (this command prompted me to enter a password, I made the password "pwd"

Next I had to make changes to the user to allow Jack to ssh into my BeagleBone
Enter the directory for the user jack
$ cd /home/jack
make an ssh file and give it the correct permissions
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R jack .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

my partner Jack performed the same steps on his BeagleBone to create a user named brian

As a client:

generate public/private keys
$ ssh-keygen
transfer the public key onto my user on my Jack's BeagleBone
$ ssh-copy-id -i brian@10.97.85.102
$ ssh-agent
$ ssh-add (adds the private key to ssh-agent)
$ ssh brian@10.97.85.102
These commands are succesful and I am able to ssh into my directory on Jack's BeagleBone without using a password
There is a lot of lag but I am able to run some commands like make text files in this directory.
